# IBM Applied Data Science Capstone

Welcome! This repository contains the labs for the IBM Applied Data Science Capstone.

I have left the materials publicly available to help fellow learners who may feel stuck or would benefit from additional reference while working through the assignments.

If you are currently enrolled in the professional certificate, I hope these notebooks provide clarity and guidance during the tougher modules.

**Disclaimer:** Please use these materials as a reference only. I encourage you to work through the labs yourself to maximize your learning and ensure compliance with academic integrity policies.

Wishing you success and continued growth in your learning path.
